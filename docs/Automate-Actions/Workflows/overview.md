# Domo Workflows

**Domo Workflows** is a low-code automation framework that allows you to orchestrate actions across the Domo platform and external systems. While Workflows can be built visually using Domo’s drag-and-drop canvas, developers can also create, manage, and execute them programmatically using the Workflow APIs.

This page provides a high-level introduction for developers looking to integrate Workflows into automated pipelines, CI/CD tooling, or external applications.

## What Makes Workflows Developer-Friendly?

- **API-driven orchestration**

  Programmatically start, manage, and interact with workflows from external systems, scripts, or even other Domo instances.

- **Custom scripting**

  Embed custom logic in JavaScript or Python steps to manipulate inputs, call APIs, or apply business logic within your flow.

- **System integration**

  Workflows can call external services, work with Domo DataSets, trigger DataFlows, and send notifications—all in one pipeline.

- **Security and governance**

  Workflows run with scoped tokens and support fine-grained permissions and execution visibility.

## What You’ll Find in This Documentation

This section of the Developer Portal provides technical guidance on:

**Authentication & API scopes**: How to generate and use tokens for managing workflows.

**Workflow API Reference**: Endpoints for listing, creating, running, and monitoring workflows.

**Scripting & Extensibility**: Using Python or JavaScript within steps to customize logic or interact with services.

**Use Cases & Examples**: Recipes for integrating Workflows into real-world automation scenarios.

## Already Familiar With Workflows?

If you're looking for information on how to use the Workflow Builder UI, configure built-in steps, or troubleshoot common issues, check out the [Domo Knowledge Base](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005108?language=en_US).

This documentation assumes familiarity with the platform and focuses on developer use cases and API-level control.
