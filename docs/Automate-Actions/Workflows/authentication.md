# Authentication & Permissions

To interact with Workflows via the Domo API, you must authenticate using an access token with the appropriate OAuth scopes or grants. This guide explains how to generate a token and what permissions are required to create, manage, and run workflows programmatically.

## Generating a Developer Token

1. Navigate to the **Admin** panel in your Domo instance.
2. Go to **Security > Access Tokens**.
3. Click **Create Token**, give it a name (e.g. `workflow-api-access`), and click **Create**.
4. Copy and store the token securely — you won’t be able to view it again.

> **Important:** Access tokens inherit the permissions of the user who created them. For production workflows, we recommend using a dedicated service account with scoped permissions.

## Required OAuth Scopes / Grants

To use the Workflow API, the token must be associated with a user who has the **Workflow API grant** enabled.

### Required grant:

- `Workflow API`

This grant allows:

- Listing workflows
- Creating and modifying workflows
- Executing workflows via API
- Retrieving logs and statuses

> You can verify that your user has this grant under `Admin > Roles > Grants` in your instance. If not, an admin must assign or create a custom role that includes it.

## API Authentication Example

Use your access token as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.domo.com/v1/workflows" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid token                         | Ensure the token is correct and included in the Authorization header |
| `403 Forbidden`    | Token lacks required grants                      | Confirm that the token's user has the Workflow API grant             |
| `404 Not Found`    | Resource does not exist or user lacks visibility | Ensure you have access to the workflow or correct ID                 |
