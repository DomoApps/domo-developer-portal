# Key Limitations

Code Engine unlocks a lot of flexibility to programatically interact with Domo and with external systems; however, it is not the right tool in all scripting scenarios.

Code Engine's key limitations are:

- **Compute**: Limited to 1 GB Memory and 5 min max runtime, which means they are not meant for heavy data processing.
- **Output**: Functions may only return a single output. More complex response types are typically handled by returning a single `object` type output
- **Dependencies**: There are a limited set of common libraries available in the JavaScript or Python environment.

Code Engine is ideal for simple, lightweight functions while Domo's Jupyter Workspace integration is ideal for more complex, heavier scripting tasks.

# Troubleshooting

If you're running into errors building or executing Code Engine, it's often worth checking one of the follow most common gotchas:

- Ensure that the user has the appropriate [permissions](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005173?language=en_US#permissions) and [grants](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005173?language=en_US#required_grants) enabled.
- Ensure correct typing of both inputs and outputs in the function. This can get trickier if you're using lists or objects. If you are using a native Domo type like `Account`, `Dataset`, `Group`, or `Person` - you can pass the id of the resource as a string to your function.
- If you are sending SQL into your function as a string, please note that it is case sensitive.
- When you're debugging functions in custom packages, you can use the `console.log` or `console.error` function to understand what is happening when you test your function.
