# Common Code Engine Use Cases

- **Workflows**: Workflows contain a series of steps – many of which are code engine functions (either global functions that Domo has written and maintains across all instances or custom ones that you write).

- **Apps**: Historically, Domo has limited the number of APIs that you can hit from an App to a small number that have been configured to work with Domo’s App Framework. However, now you can connect apps to any API securely (internal and external) by wiring the App to trigger a Code Engine function. See our guide to [hitting Code Engine functions from a Domo App](../App-Framework/Guides/hitting-code-engine-from-an-app.md).

> ### Pro-tip
>
> Domo has a global package to start a DataFlow. Jupyter Notebooks in Domo can be scheduled as DataFlows. This means that you can spin up and run a Jupyter job via Code Engine, which can be useful when you'd like to do heavier data processing.
