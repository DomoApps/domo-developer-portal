# Global vs. Custom Packages

Domo provides a library of general packages and their related functions for common integrations and services that anyone with access to Code Engine can use. You can also create functions with custom code to perform automated services in your instance.

## Global packages

Domo maintains a wide range of packages across all Domo instances. These global packages generally fall into two distinct categories:

1. Taking common actions in Domo by leveraging the Product APIs
2. Utility functions for manipulating small amounts of data

## Custom packages

By creating custom packages you can write functions beyond what is covered in the global packages. Common use-cases for custom packages are:

- to hit Domo APIs not covered by a global package
- to hit non-Domo APIs to trigger events in external systems
- to reshape inputs and outputs a across steps in a Workflow

For custom packages, you will also likely leverage a few key Code Engine specific functions.

`codeengine.sendRequest` provides a wrapper around internal Domo APIs and inherits authentication from the user making the request. You can [see an example Javascript request here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005173?language=en_US#code_engine_send_request).

`codeengine.getAccount` securely reads in credentials stored in Domo's Account layer, which you can use in requests to external APIs. See a Javascript [example here](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005173?language=en_US#codeengine.getAccount).

`codeengine.axios` provides access to the [Axios library](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), which you can use to send requests to external APIs and handle authentication yourself. This can be beneficial when you want to run a function:

- using a service account
- to hit Domo APIs across Domo instances
- to hit external APIs
