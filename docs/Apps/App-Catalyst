**App Catalyst: User Guide**

**Summary**

App Catalyst empowers you to instantly create Domo Pro-Code applications. These apps can integrate directly with your Domo datasets and can be added to Domo Dashboards and App Studio. Whether you need a comprehensive KPI dashboard, a practical data entry application, or a single, impactful visualization like a bar chart, the generator can build it based on your natural language specifications.

Start with one of the example prompts or add your own to see App Catalyst in action. If you are returning to a previous project, you can find it in the History tab. If you have already loaded data into Domo you can have App Catalyst model the app from the data. If you haven't loaded data into Domo, App Catalyst will model some dummy data that can easily be replaced in the Pro-Code editor.

*Best Practices:* If you start with a Domo Dataset, App Catalyst will use that data as a model when building the app and add the appropriate data App Framework APIs to your project.

If you are returning to App Catalyst, your previous projects can be found in the History tab.

*Best Practices:* It is best to bump the version of your project if you plan to return to the project's history. App Catalyst will overwrite the first version (0.0.1).

**Key Features**

**App Catalyst: From Prompt to Preview**

The core of the App Catalyst is its ability to turn your ideas into functional applications.

**• Describe Your Vision:** Start by providing a text prompt describing the app you want to build. The more specific and detailed you are in your description, the more accurate the generated app will be to your requirements.

You can start simple like 
"I want to track the Fat Bear's of Katmai National Park and Preserve. Track by weight, by votes, winners by year" 

or add more description like 
"Measuring key Marketing metrics like return on investment (ROI), conversion rates, and customer lifetime value, businesses can gain actionable insights to personalize customer experiences, allocate marketing budgets more effectively, and achieve their business objectives. Web Analytics: Tracks website visitors, page views, bounce rates, and user behavior. Social Media Analytics: Monitors engagement, reach, and audience sentiment on social platforms. Email Marketing Analytics: Measures open rates, click-through rates, and conversions from email campaigns. CRM Systems: Provides customer data and interaction history. Advertising Platforms: Tracks ad performance, cost per click, and ad engagement." 

To specifying exactness 
"I'm a healthcare practice managing 500+ patients across 8 doctors. Build a HIPAA-compliant patient management system with appointment calendar, medical history timeline, and prescription tracking tables. Display upcoming appointments in daily/weekly views, patient visit history with searchable notes, and medication refill alerts. Include quick-action buttons for rescheduling appointments and sending SMS reminders. Filter by doctor, appointment type, or date range. Show key metrics like no-show rates and average visit duration in dashboard cards. Use clean, professional design with blue and white colors, optimized for desktop and tablet use by medical staff.".

**• Live Generation & Editing:** Once you submit your prompt, the generator will process your request and build the application. You will see the complete code in a real-time, fully functional code editor. You can review, modify, and refine the code as needed.

**• Instant Preview:** As you make changes to the code, you can immediately preview the UI to see how your edits affect the final product, ensuring a tight feedback loop between coding and design.

**Saving Your App**

Saving will copy your app to the Asset Library. The Asset Library contains all the assets in your organization's instance, including apps. You can manage apps that you have created and apps that have been shared with you. If you have an Admin default security role, you can also manage all apps that exist in the instance.

**Publishing Your App**

Once you are satisfied with your application, you can publish it directly from App Catalyst to the Pro-Code Editor for further development or to an App Studio app.

**The Domo App Platform: What the Generator Abstracts**

While App Catalyst provides a seamless, prompt-driven experience, it builds upon Domo's powerful pro-code app platform. For those curious about what's happening behind the scenes, this section outlines the traditional development process and highlights the complexities the App Generator handles for you.

**The Traditional Pro-Code Workflow**

Developing a custom app for Domo has traditionally involved several manual steps for setup, development, and deployment.

**Local Environment Setup:** Developers begin by setting up a local development environment. This involves installing **Node.js** and the **DomoApps CLI** (Command Line Interface). For detailed instructions, see the official documentation: [Setup and](https://developer.domo.com/portal/6hlzv1hinkq19-setup-and-installation)

[Installation](https://developer.domo.com/portal/6hlzv1hinkq19-setup-and-installation).

**Local Development:** Using an IDE like **Cursor** or **VS Code**, developers write the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like React are also supported.

**Packaging for Publication:** Before an app can be published to Domo, it requires a thumbnail image and a crucial manifest.json file. This manifest file must contain specific properties and manually map any datasets, collections, or workflows the app uses.

**Publishing and Asset Creation:** The app is then published using the CLI. A successful publication creates an **Asset** within the Domo Asset Library. You can learn more about assets here: [Domo Asset Library KB](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/4403442101143?language=en_US).

**Card Creation and Wiring:** From the newly created asset, you must then create a **Card**. This card is the component that can be placed into a Domo Dashboard or App Studio. Once the card exists, there is an additional **wiring** screen where you must again map the necessary datasets and collections to the card.

**How the App Generator Simplifies the Process**

App Catalyst abstracts this entire multi-step process into a simple, integrated workflow:

**• Integrated Development Environment:** While Domo already offers an [in-browser Pro-Code Editor](https://developer.domo.com/portal/3ad3f9b434b10-getting-started-with-the-pro-code-editor) to lower the barrier to entry of building apps.

**• Automated Packaging and Manifest:** The generator automatically creates the required manifest.json file, thumbnail, and all necessary properties based on your app's content, including data mappings.

**• One-Click Deployment:** The "Save" or "Publish" button orchestrates the entire deployment pipeline. It handles the publishing, asset creation, card generation in a single, automated step, making your app instantly available for use in dashboards.

**• Full Compatibility:** Apps created with the App Catalyst are fully standard. Once published, you can open and continue to edit them in Domo's regular Pro-Code Editor, giving you the best of both worlds: rapid AI-powered generation and the option for

manual, fine-grained control.

**FAQ**

Q: How does App Catalyst work?
A: Starting with a natural language description of what you are looking for, App Catalyst will convert the request into a functional pro-code app (index.html, manifest.json, app.js, app.js, thumbnail.png)

Q: Can I make edits via the prompt to the project?
A: Currently no, each prompt will re-generate the project. We are working on streamlined editing to support minor edits.

Q: Do I have to use the pro-code editor?
A: No, once your project is saved to the Asset Library, you can download the project and do traditional app development with your favorite tools. Domo's App Developer Framework

Q: Do I need coding experience to take advantage of App Catalyst?
A: No, App Catalyst is specifically designed for beginners & business users with no prior coding experience. However, editing, data wiring, and additional functionality will need to be done by a developer who is familiar with Javascript.
