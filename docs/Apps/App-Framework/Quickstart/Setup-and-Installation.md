# Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Install the Domo Apps CLI

---

The [Domo Apps CLI](../Tools/domo-CLI.md) is the command line tool you can use to authenticate against your Domo Instance and publish your apps there.

<!--
type: tab
title: npm
-->

The DomoApps CLI is now distributed **only** through npm (Node Package Manager). Homebrew and Chocolatey are no longer supported and will not receive updates.  
If you have previously installed the DomoApps CLI using Homebrew or Chocolatey, please uninstall those versions before installing via npm.

To install the CLI, run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g ryuu
```

Confirm that `domo` has been installed successfully by running `domo --version` from the terminal. If a version number is returned then you have successfully installed the CLI.

<strong>Notice:</strong> As of June 18th, 2025, the Homebrew installation method is no longer supported. Please use the npm installation method in the "npm" tab above.
</div>

If you previously installed the CLI with Homebrew, uninstall it with:

```bash
brew uninstall domo
```

Then, install using npm as shown in the npm tab.

<div style="background-color:#ffdddd; color:#a94442; border:1px solid #a94442; padding:10px; margin-bottom:16px;">
<strong>Notice:</strong> As of June 18th, 2025, the Chocolatey installation method is no longer supported. Please use the npm installation method in the "npm" tab above.
</div>

If you previously installed the CLI with Chocolatey, uninstall it with:

```powershell
choco uninstall domo
```

Then, install using npm as shown in the npm tab.

<!-- type: tab-end -->

### Step 2: Login to your Domo Instance

---

From your command-line, run `domo login` and then select `new instance`.

Enter your assigned instance URL and then press enter. You'll then be presented with a login screen and the Domo CLI will be authorized on your instance.

**Connecting Through a Proxy**

If your organization has a firewall set up that blocks you from hitting Domo endpoints, you'll need to work with your network administrators to use the Domo Apps CLI with a proxy server. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

Set the CLI to route requests through your proxy with the following command:

```bash
domo proxy <Proxy server name> <Port number>
```

Note: if your proxy requires an authentication step, you can add the `-a` flag (`domo proxy -a`), which will ask for your proxy username and will then also require the proxy password on all subsequent `domo` apps cli commands.

### Step 3: Create a New App

---

Run the following commands from your command line to set up a new Domo App project.

<pre><code>domo init
</code></pre>

### Step 4: Leverage Domo App Platform APIs in your Web Application

---

You can now easily integrate Domo APIs into any front-end web application. See [Tutorials](../Tutorials/Vanilla-Javascript/SugarForce.md) or [API Reference](../../../API-Reference/Domo-App-APIs/AppDB-API.md) for code examples. If you don’t have a pre-existing web application, in addition to the simple `domo init` templates, we have a number of [Starter Kits](Starter-Kits.md) you can use to get up and running quickly whether you prefer React, Angular, or Vue for front-end development.

### Step 5: Publish App to Domo Instance

---

We publish our final product to Domo using

<pre><code>domo publish</code></pre>

Once your app is deployed as a card, you can share it like you would any other content in Domo.
